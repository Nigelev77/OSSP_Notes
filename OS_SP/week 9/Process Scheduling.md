# Scheduling

## Scheduling problem

Processes compete for resources (eg CPU time)

OS must define a scheduling system to manage process access time to these resources, typically through a queuing system for a resource

## Process Scheduling Queues

-**Job queue** - set of all processes in system
-**Ready queue** - set of all processes in memory ready and waiting to execute
-**Device queues** - set of processes waiting for IO device

Processes move between these queues
